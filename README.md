# Dual-Microcontroller-Based-Door-Locker-Security-System-Using-Password-Authentication
## **Standard Embedded Diploma - Final Project**

## Project Overview:
This smart door control system is designed with two microcontrollers, one acting as the
Human-Machine Interface (HMI_ECU) and the other as the Control Unit (Control_ECU). Users
interact with the system using an LCD and keypad to enter passwords, which are verified and
stored using external EEPROM. The door is controlled by an H-bridge circuit connected to a
motor, and the system includes a PIR sensor for motion detection, a buzzer for alarms, and
password-protected access to system options like door unlocking and password changing.
## Features:
1. Password Protection: Users can set and verify a password stored in external EEPROM.
2. LCD and Keypad Interface: Allows easy interaction for entering and managing
passwords.
3. UART Communication: HMI_ECU sends and receives data to and from Control_ECU via
UART.
4. EEPROM Storage: Passwords and system data are stored securely in an external
EEPROM.
5. Motorized Door Control: The door is unlocked/locked using a motor driven by an Hbridge.
6. Buzzer Alert: The buzzer is activated for failed password attempts and system alerts.
7. PIR Motion Sensor: Detects motion to trigger door operations.
8. Password Change Option: Users can change the password after verification.
9. Security Lock: System locks for one minute if the password is entered incorrectly three
times consecutively.
